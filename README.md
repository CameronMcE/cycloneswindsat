About Data used in the journal manuscript 'An assessment of Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical cyclones in ERA5 using WindSat'

Main Figures:

Figure 1: Subplot (a) was created using the .tif file 'trkdenSumAll' contaning the density of the cyclone tracks across the equal area projection. 'lat.tif' and 'lon.tif' were used to align the track density with the spatial coordinates. Subplot (b) was created using the .npy file 'radii_max' which contains an array of the maximum radius reached by each individual cyclone track.

Figure 2: Subplots (a-c) was created using the .nc file 'uv10'. It contains arrays for the ERA5, WindSat and difference plots in the dimenions of radius and angle. It also includes windpeed arrays for u and v wind speed used to plot the wind vectors. The other subplots were similarly created using the 'tcwv', 'clw' and 'mtpr' .nc files.

Figure 3: Subplots (a-c) was created using the .nc file 'tcwv_amsr'. The other subplots were similarly created using the 'clw' and 'mtpr' .nc files.

Figure 4: Subplots (a) was created using the .nc file 'uv10_scatter'. The other subplots were similarly created using the 'tcwv_scatter' and 'clw_scatter' and 'mtpr_scatter' .nc files.

Figure 5 was created using the .nc file 'tcwv_regions'.

Figure 6 was created using the .nc file 'clw_regions'.

Figure 7 was created using the .nc file 'mtpr_regions'.

Figure 8 was created using the .nc files 'tcwv_regions', 'clw_regions', and 'mtpr_regions' used in Figures 5 - 7.

Supplementary Figures:

Figure 1: Created using 'windhist.nc'

Figure 2: Created using 'vv.nc'

Cyclone tracks:
Cyclone tracks for each month acrsoss the period of analysis are included. Cyclone tracks are stored in the month they experience cyclolysis.
